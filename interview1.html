<p style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewee Introduction: A homemaker and mother of 2 young girls aged 7 and 4, living in a nuclear family in the city.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>In what ways do your daughters use digital screens?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />Starting out, I&rsquo;d allowed both of them to play games and watch videos on my phone. My eldest also uses it to study and do hifz. But now, the only leisure screentime they enjoy is the TV. Along with that, we reserve TV mainly for family time. When their father comes home at night, him and the girls pick a movie or a show to watch together and this has become a nice bonding experience for all of them. They enjoy asking him questions about what they&rsquo;re watching, sharing their commentaries, making jokes etc. We&rsquo;d also let them watch TV while having dinner, but we have gradually stopped that as well.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My eldest is only allowed half an hour of passive screentime daily.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My youngest has started kindergarten, when she comes home, I make sure that I am free, I put everything on pause and give her my undivided attention. I ask her about her day, talk to her and let her play in the bath a little bit. Usually after that she&rsquo;s tired enough that she eats, watches a bit of TV and then takes a nap. I&rsquo;d say she watches TV for less than 2 hours throughout the entire day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>Have you always been mindful of your children&rsquo;s screentime?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />Truth be told, I didn&rsquo;t really think much about their screen time. I had some general awareness because I saw the way other children were with screens and technology. It dawned on me very early on with my daughters that screen use is going to be a modern problem, and I have to be careful with the way they use it. It&rsquo;s not always perfect, and screens are inevitable, but I let them use them for leisure, as long as I feel like I have a solid say in how they do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>What do you consider as &lsquo;getting out of hand&rsquo; in regard to screen use?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />If they are active and physical play is a part of their day, I don&rsquo;t mind them watching videos or playing games. Especially, when I am aware of what kind of media they watch. Occasionally, when I&rsquo;m too tired, or it&rsquo;s just one of those days where they are not going to listen to me, I even let them use screens during dinner. But I draw the line at using screens during <em>majalis, </em>other <em>dawat</em> events, and whenever we go out<em>.</em> I actively do everything I can to avoid that, and since the beginning I have never let them use phone when we are out, and thus far, I have been pretty successful with it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>Is there a kind of media you want them to avoid but they still end up watching it?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />Yes! It&rsquo;s the kind of video where the sounds are too loud, they use a lot of attractive primary colours, and the children are usually unboxing different toys. I&rsquo;d say the worst are the prank videos, they do only harm in my opinion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>What do you do when they are watching these videos? How can a parent avoid that kind of content?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />I avoid saying no out right, I think saying no would make them want to watch it more. Instead, I let them watch for a bit and try to divert them to some other activity. I typically do not interact with these kinds of videos, when on the other hand, with other kinds of content- I talk to them about it, ask questions and show interest in it. Slowly, we&rsquo;ve managed to limit my youngest&rsquo;s YouTube content to only one channel. My eldest mainly watches content I approve of, so I don&rsquo;t need to monitor her watch history all the time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>Any tips or tricks that have helped you with decreasing your daughter&rsquo;s screentime?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />Yes, my eldest only has 30 minutes of daily screentime, when she wishes to watch for a little longer, she has to pay a small fee of 5 Rs 5 from her allowance. This has helped not only in controlling screentime, but also giving her a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Question:<br /><strong>Any advice for our readers?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Answer:<br />Find your balance, and find what system works for you and your family. The reality is that creating healthy screen use habits requires effort. And you have to decide what your boundaries are. Kids need to learn how to use technology wisely without becoming addicted to it. Sometimes life gets too busy, and you will find yourself allowing your kids to watch tv for longer than usual or play video games too often. But, as long as they are being active, they&rsquo;re able to concentrate on school, and are able to live life without having a constant itch to use screens- then, in my opinion, you&rsquo;re doing pretty well.</p>

Here are some key instances when we tend to use phones the most:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Unwinding After Work or Events:</b> It's common to reach for our phones when we come home after a long day or when we're relaxing after an event. These moments of downtime can become opportunities for our children to observe our screen habits.</li>
    <li><b>During Breakfast or Meals:</b>Many of us check our phones during meals, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. This habit can inadvertently send the message that screens are more important than connecting with family during mealtime.</li>
    <li><b>While Watching a Show:</b>Watching TV or streaming content on our devices often goes hand in hand with using our phones. Kids notice this association and may adopt it.</li>
    <li><b>In Bed - Before and After Sleep:</b>Scrolling through our phones in bed before falling asleep and immediately after waking up has become a common routine. Children may pick up on this behavior, potentially affecting their sleep patterns.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be mindful of our screen use and set a positive example for our children, we can start by tracking our own digital technology use. Many smartphones have tracking features that monitor screen time. By using these features, we can gain insight into our habits and evaluate whether changes are needed. We could even involve our children in this process by asking them to keep track of their screen time as well. This can lead to valuable discussions where we compare our usage patterns and decide together if adjustments are necessary.</p>

<p>Furthermore, engaging in open conversations with our children about the applications we use, the people and groups we follow, or interesting content we've come across can foster a safe and trusting environment at home. It's crucial to create an atmosphere where it's okay to discuss screen time and digital technology use without judgment. By sharing our experiences and insights, we can help our children navigate the digital world responsibly and develop healthy screen habits that will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>]]></content><author><name>Salma Kothari</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a role model for healthy screen use is essential in today's digital age, especially when it comes to influencing our children's behavior.

<p>Have you ever spotted a fluffy parade of ducklings wobbling behind their mother, and thought, "Geez, they've got it easy!"? Oh, how we envy Mama Duck! Her young ones follow her without questioning, "Why?". No tantrums. No “I don’t wanna.” But, what if ducks had the same dilemmas as us humans? Let's take a quack at it, shall we?</p>

<p>Imagine Mama Duck's morning. She's got to get her ducklings in a row, literally! There’s Daisy who's trying to eat a pebble, Donald is busy chasing his tail (do ducks have tails?), and Daffy... well, he’s just being daffy, looking skyward and asking deep existential questions about the universe. Sound familiar?</p>

<div class="fun-fact">
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Ducks have an innate following mechanism called 'imprinting'. Lucky for them, their kids imprint and follow. Humans? Not so much. Our little rascals have 'inquiring'. They question. A lot!</p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src='/Users/husainsuksar/Downloads/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll-master/img/posts/ducklings.jpg' alt="demo pic">

</div>

<p>So, you see, in an alternate duck universe, parenting woes are real! Just as ducklings might waddle out of line, our children, curious and ever-exploring, often stray from our carefully charted paths. They’re just eager to dive into life's pond, even if it means getting a little wet and muddy.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a parent-child outing at the park. In our duck-world scenario, Mama Duck would be quacking frantically into her duck-phone, seeking advice from Dr. Quack about Daffy's recent fear of water. Daisy, in the meantime, has discovered her reflection in the pond and is having a deep conversation with it. Oh, and Donald? He's picked up bread crumbs from questionable sources (shady pigeons, no doubt).</p>

<p>But here's the thing, no matter how chaotic, Mama Duck, like all parents, wears her invisible superhero cape (feathered edition). With a mix of love, patience, and a pinch of humor, she'd manage to guide her quirky ducklings through the highs and lows of ducklinghood.</p>

<div class="fun-fact">
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Ever noticed how ducks appear calm on the surface but paddle like mad underwater? That's parenthood in a nutshell!</p>
</div>

<p>But what can we, the not-so-feathered kind, learn from this? Well, the duck tale (pun intended!) reminds us to embrace the chaos, the unpredictability, and yes, even the occasional defiance that comes with parenting. Because, let’s be honest, if our kids just followed us mindlessly, life would be a tad too... boring.</p>

<p>Let’s celebrate those little rebellious moments, the incessant "why's", the muddy footprints on the living room carpet, and the impromptu dance sessions. They're evidence of lively minds, challenging boundaries, and forging their own paths. And isn’t that what we want? Little ducklings growing into confident ducks who aren’t afraid to spread their wings (once they get them, of course).</p>

<p>So, the next time your child tests your patience or ventures off the path, think of Mama Duck. Take a deep breath, ruffle your feathers, and dive back in with love and a dash of humor. Because, in the end, whether in diapers or downy feathers, they're all just trying to find their way in this big pond we call life.</p>

<p>Happy parenting, and may your duckling days be filled with love, laughter, and only the occasional misplaced pebble snack!</p>]]></content><author><name>Salma Kothari</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of Ducklings and Diapers: The Quirky Guide to Parenting Woes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Failure is not an option</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/2020/01/29/exploration.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Failure is not an option" /><published>2020-01-29T06:45:13+03:00</published><updated>2020-01-29T06:45:13+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/2020/01/29/exploration</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/2020/01/29/exploration.html"><![CDATA[<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.

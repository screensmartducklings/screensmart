<p><strong>Interacting With Your Child&rsquo;s Screen</strong></p>
<p>Before you can catch up with the latest technology, it changes, evolves, and becomes outdated. Being parents in this modern world also means understanding new technological features and how they relate to your children. One of the most effective ways to do this is by simply talking about it to your child. Interacting through screen use helps to create a safe, trusting environment at home where it&rsquo;s okay to talk openly about screen time and digital technology use.</p>
<p><strong>Building Relationships through Screens</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discuss Quality Content:</strong> Engage with your child about what constitutes good quality in apps, games, and TV shows. Explain why certain content is more beneficial, educational, or appropriate. Share with your child your favourite movies and shows and talk about why you like or dislike a certain character. You can also show your child apps and sites that are fun, interesting, or educational and explain how to save these for later.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Inquisitiveness:</strong> Watch a program or play a game with your child. Ask them questions about the game like how to make a certain move, what they think is a good strategy to complete a level or win a challenge, or what features they&rsquo;d add if they were the game maker that would enhance the game. Ask them why they think this game has in-app purchases. These types of questions promote creativity and critical thinking and shows your child that you are invested in them and are interested to know more about the things they enjoy.</li>

<li><strong>Keep a check on each other:</strong> Use shared screen time to discuss character behaviour, safety, and respect. This not only builds your relationship but also instils critical thinking about media content. You can compare each other&rsquo;s screen use patterns and ask our child for suggestions on how you can improve and what you can do to boost productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Open Discussions:</strong> Share with your child the apps you use and the content you consume. Create an environment where discussing digital technology use is normal and safe. Ask them questions like: What&rsquo;s the point of this YouTube video? Why is the person showing that product?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Raising a Smart and Aware Child:</strong></p>
<p>When you are sharing screens and navigating content together, teaching opportunities present themselves. For example, you&rsquo;re researching online about something, and a pop-up comes up. This is a chance for you to explain the nature of pop-up ads and the importance of not clicking on them indiscriminately. Pop-ups can be advertisements, they might be &lsquo;click-bait&rsquo; for spreading misinformation, and they might have links that can track your activity or steal personal data.</p>

<p>Treat online environments as you would in real-life settings. You can teach them online etiquette. For example, if you&rsquo;re having a conversation with someone and someone else calls out to you, or tries to start a new conversation with you, you wouldn&rsquo;t just drop your conversation with the previous person and start interacting with the newcomer, instead you&rsquo;d finish the first conversation before moving on to the next one. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re interrupted by a notification or a call on your phone while you&rsquo;re in conversation with your child, teach them to build good character by not cutting them off and getting distracted by the notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Screen Time and Interaction</strong></p>

<p>By being an active participant rather than a passive monitor of your child's online life, you are maintaining open lines of communication for sharing about digital media use. Studies have shown a between teens who have good communication with their parents about technology use and the effect it has on their mental health. They tend to fare better than those with unhealthy digital habits and low communication. (JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting, 5(2), 2022). As for younger children, encourage two-way communication. Real conversations, whether in-person or through video chat, are crucial for language development and emotional connection. Research has shown that it's the "back-and-forth conversation" that improves language skills&mdash;much more so than "passive" listening or one-way interaction with a screen. (Journal of Child Language, 48(2), 2021). So, when you&rsquo;re co-viewing content together, you are substituting your child&rsquo;s solo viewing time with a shared experience that promotes interaction and communication, which ultimately enriches your relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Interacting with your child's screen time is not just about setting limits; it's about engagement, education, and setting an example. By actively participating in your child's digital life, you can turn screen time into an enriching, educational, and relationship-building tool. Remember, the goal is to guide your child to use technology responsibly and thoughtfully, enhancing their overall development and family bonding in the digital age.</p>

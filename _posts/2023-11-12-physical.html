<p><strong>Screen Time &amp; Children's Physical Health: A Parent's Guide</strong></p>
<p>Children are exposed to screens more than ever before. While technology has its benefits, excessive screen time can have several negative health impacts. This article explores these effects and offers practical advice for parents to mitigate them, emphasizing having a friendly and empathetic approach to this modern parenting challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Negative Impact on Physical Well-being</strong></p>
<p>Excessive screen time negatively impacts children&rsquo;s physical health in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weight and Diet:</strong> High screen time, especially TV viewing, is linked to a high risk of obesity in children. Watching TV for more than 1.5 hours daily is a risk factor for obesity for children 4 through 9 years of age. Teens who watch more than 5 hours of TV per day are 5 times more likely to be overweight than teens who watch 0 to 2 hours. Food advertising and snacking while watching TV can promote obesity. Sedentary behaviour and lack of physical activity due to excessive viewing means less time spent per day on exercise, outdoor activities, and active play. If your child has spiralled into passive viewing for hours on end, this increases the likelihood of obesity and heart issues.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep Disturbances: </strong>Our bodies have a natural clock that tells us when it&rsquo;s time for us to rest. Staring at bright screens and the blue light from digital screens can suppress melatonin levels, making it hard to fall asleep. Lack of sleep has its own set of adverse effects like impaired cognitive performance and mood issues.</li>

<li><strong>Poor Posture:</strong> If we&rsquo;re being honest, adults are guilty of having a bad posture when sitting and watching TV, playing a video game, or simply while scrolling on their phones. Poor posture in kids, whose bodies are still developing, can cause issues like back pain, neck pain and sometimes even wrist pain due to holding their devices in their hands for long periods of time. This continuous strain on the spine may cause pain and issues in development.</li>
<li><strong>Low Bone Density:</strong> Lack of physical activity and time spent outside during the night can cause decreased bone density and low Vitamin D levels in children and adolescents. Low bone density increases the chance of developing osteoporosis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protecting Your Child's Posture</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Phone and Laptop Positioning:</strong> Unless your child is pretending to be the Hunchback of Notre Dame, he/she shouldn&rsquo;t be hunched over all the time! Position the screen at the eye level of your child.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Posture:</strong> Ensure the spine is straight and neutral. You can make a fun little game out of this, whenever you yell: &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; like an army colonel, this is a reminder to your little soldier to sit up straight.</li>
<li><strong>Designated Work Area:</strong> Instead use doing work or watching a movie from the couch or the bed, encourage using the screens at a proper workstation, or table.</li>
<li><strong>Chair Height and Positioning: </strong>Proper chair height can make or break a posture. Adjust the chair height so your child's feet rest flat on the floor. You may need to use blankets or pillows on their seat to raise their field of vision. You can also use a small step stool where they can rest their feet, if the chair is a bit tall for them.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent Breaks:</strong> Encourage regular stretching or walking breaks. For example, you can challenge your child to see how many sit-ups or jumping jacks they can do before the ad ends. Or you can set a timer and ask them to do a little jog or a stretch.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Screens and Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Extended periods of screen time - especially close-up screen use like tablets and smartphones - can have detrimental effects on children's physical health, particularly their eyesight and vision. Excessive screen time is associated with an increased risk of near-sightedness, dry eyes, and other issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eye Fatigue:</strong> Just like your biceps and triceps get tired after an intense workout, the muscles around the eyes get tired too. Continuous screen focus is a lot of heavy lifting for the eyes. This can cause headaches and concentration difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>Blurry Vision:</strong> Focusing on objects at a fixed distance for long periods of time can cause temporary spasms of the eye's accommodation system, resulting in blurred vision when shifting one's gaze away from the screen. This condition, called an accommodation spasm, arises as the eye's focusing muscles "lock up" after prolonged use. Some research also implies a potential link between excessive screen viewing and other indoor near-work activities to increasing rates of myopia, or near-sightedness, among young children, though this is yet to be proven. Allotting more time for outdoor unstructured play may support healthier ocular development in children.</li>
<li><strong>Dry Eyes:</strong> Without our realization, we tend to blink less when we&rsquo;re concentrating on digital screens. This reduced blinking causes dry eyes. Often, the screen of a TV or a laptop tends to be situated higher compared to your child&rsquo;s eye level. As a result, the upper eyelids tend to be open wider, speeding up evaporation of the eye's tear film. Dry eyes feel irritated, gritty, and tired.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prevalence of any of these issues can cause frequent headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Eye Strain</strong></p>
<p>They might get a little annoyed at you for randomly telling them to: &lsquo;Blink! Blink!&rsquo;. So, try to implement the following as much as you can. Firstly, for yourself, and then make a conscious effort to remind your little ones to do the same.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Nature&rsquo;s care: </strong>Rasulullah <sup>SAW</sup> states that &lsquo;The sight of greenery improves one&rsquo;s vision&rsquo;. Some studies have implied that because our eyes are at the peak of their perception to detect the wavelengths corresponding with the colour green, the shade has a calming effect on us.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>The 20-20-20 Rule:</strong> Children look at objects at varying distances for varying amounts of time during the course of the day. However, prolonged screen time makes the lenses of the eyes focus on a single object. So, every 20 minutes, encourage your child to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Proper Screen Placement:</strong> Ensure the screen is at or slightly below eye level. You don&rsquo;t need any fancy tools for this. Use whatever you have at home as a DIY stand.</li>
<li><strong>The 1-2-10 Rule:</strong> Position smartphones 1 foot, computers 2 feet, and TVs 10 feet away from your child's eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Lighting and Screen Brightness:</strong> Match screen brightness with room lighting and reduce glare. Try to dim the room&rsquo;s lights a little to avoid glare on the screen, this put a strain on the eye when trying to focus.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Tips to Keep Leisure Screen Time in Check</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Establish Limits:</strong> Set clear rules for how long and when your child can use screens.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Physical Activity:</strong> Replace some screen time with outdoor play.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Limited Screen Time after </strong><strong>Sundown:</strong> Your child might be tempted to stay up late to chat with friends or play games. Encourage your child to connect with friends during the day rather than late in the evening.</li>

<li><strong>Screen-Free Bedrooms:</strong> Keep devices out of bedrooms to improve sleep quality.</li>
<li><strong>Family Involvement:</strong> Engage in non-screen activities together as a family.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While screens are an integral part of modern life, balancing their use is key to ensuring your child's healthy development. By understanding the risks and implementing these strategies, parents can help mitigate the negative effects of screen time. Remember, it's about finding a balance that works for your family and fostering a healthy relationship with technology.</p>

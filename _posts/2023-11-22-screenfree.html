<p><strong>Screen-free Activities</strong></p>
<p>Boredom, often viewed negatively, is a natural aspect of life. It's important to remember that boredom isn't a problem to be solved, but a space to be explored. In these moments of 'unplugged' time, creativity has a chance to blossom. When children are not constantly entertained by screens, they learn to engage their imagination, develop problem-solving skills, and discover personal interests. This exploration is crucial in fostering a well-rounded, innovative mindset that will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Encouraging 'independent play' is a vital component of this journey. Independent play isn&rsquo;t just about keeping children occupied; it&rsquo;s about empowering them to make decisions, entertain themselves, and feel confident in their abilities. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be distant &ndash; your role as a guide and supporter is irreplaceable. However, giving them the freedom to play alone allows them to develop a sense of self and the ability to enjoy their own company. It teaches resilience, encourages self-expression, and helps them learn to manage their own time and resources.</p>
<p>As parents, finding time to actively engage with our children without the interference of digital media can be difficult. This engagement doesn't always have to be structured or planned. Sometimes, the most meaningful interactions come from spontaneous, simple moments together &ndash; be it a walk in the park, a game of make-believe, or a shared hobby. These activities not only strengthen your bond but also show your child the joy that can be found beyond the screen.</p>
<p>We want to provide you with a list of various activities that can replace screen time, emphasizing the value these activities bring to your child's development. From arts and crafts to fun games, each activity is an opportunity to ignite your child's curiosity and creativity. Remember, every child is unique, and what captivates one may not interest another. It's all about exploring different avenues and discovering what resonates with your child.</p>
<p><strong>Quick and Easy Games</strong></p>

<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><strong>Limbo</strong>: Limbo is a fun game where you'll need a broomstick. Find two older children or adults to hold the ends of the broomstick. The goal is for players to go under the stick without touching it. If someone touches the stick, they're out. After everyone has taken a turn, you can lower the stick in small steps to make it more challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Lemon and Spoon</strong>: To play the lemon and spoon race, you must balance a lemon on a spoon and race to a finish line without dropping the lemon. The objective is to reach the finish line first while keeping the lemon on the spoon. If the lemon falls, the player must stop and pick it up before continuing. The first person to cross the finish line with the lemon still on the spoon wins the race.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>Simon Says</strong>: You can take turns being &ldquo;Simon&rdquo;. You can also switch things up by playing this game in different languages your child is learning.</li>
<li><strong>Tape&rsquo;s Web</strong> (Requires preparation): Use any sort of broad tape that does not rip off wallpaper or paint and create a rough shape of a spider&rsquo;s web with the sticky side exposed. Now stick small toys and items on the sticky side and let your child rescue them! To make things more interesting, challenge them to use tongs or chopsticks to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Racer Scissors</strong> (Requires preparation): Draw different styles of racetracks with a dotted or dashed line in the centre of each track on a piece of paper. Take a pair of scissors (make sure it&rsquo;s child-safe!) and stick a small picture or a drawing of a car on the top blade. The task is to cut along the midlines of the racetrack. You can make multiple copies of the same track and have your kids race each other.</li>
<li><strong>Balloon in the Air</strong>: The challenge is to not let the balloon touch the floor while transferring small items from one basket to another. Your child can keep pushing the balloon up with their hand. You can a timer to see how many items they can transfer while keeping the balloon in the air!</li>
<li><strong>Body Bridge:</strong> Ask your child to lie on their hands and knees. Instruct them to only let red balls pass through, every time you roll a different coloured ball, they have to close the bridge bringing their face towards their knees.</li>
<li><strong>Cut the Reward </strong>(Requires preparation): Take small items like a toy car, snacks, written tokens for extra play time, simple activities like jumping ten times etc. Use equal lengths of strings and tie each item to different string. Now pass all the strings through an empty paper roll, so that you can&rsquo;t know which string is tied to which item. Place a few empty strings to make it more exciting. Kids can take turns cutting one string at a time and whatever item drops is their reward or their chore!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Arts And Crafts</strong></p>

<br>
&nbsp;
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Invention Box</strong>: Fill a cardboard box with random items or things like bottles and cartons that you might be through away. Give your child basic craft supplies and tell them to invent something. Let them use their creativity and imagination to come up with &lsquo;inventions&rsquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Origami</strong>. They can make paper cranes, flowers, and other things to decorate their room.</li>
<li><strong>Aluminium Crafts</strong>: Get creative with aluminium foil and see what you can craft!</li>
<li><strong>Ice Cube Painting</strong> (Requires preparation): Fill an ice tray with different coloured water. You can use watercolour paints or food dye to do so. Place toothpicks in each individual ice cube slot and freeze it. Let your kids experiment painting with ice cubes!</li>
<li><strong>Tissue Mosaic</strong> (Requires preparation): Make tiny tissue balls (you can also use bits paper with you want, but tissue is more absorbent). Mix a little water with tempera or acrylic paints and pour your desired colour on the tiny balls (You can skip this step by simply using coloured tissue papers). Now sketch or print a simple design and fill in the areas with different colours!</li>
<li><strong>DIY Projector</strong> (Requires preparation): Take a piece of plastic wrap and with permanent or OHP markers, let your kids draw and create on it. Now take an empty paper roll and with a rubber band attach the drawing to one end of the tube. (You can also use a broad transparent tape instead of a plastic wrap if it is enough to cover the diameter of the paper roll). Dim the lights and use the torch to shine light through the open end of the roll and project your child&rsquo;s creation onto the wall! You can also do the same thing with a shoe box, but you&rsquo;ll have to cut a small hole to let light pass through from the opposite side.</li>
<li><strong>Group Art</strong>: Start a collaborative drawing by having each person add to it in turns.</li>
<li>You can ask your children to <strong>recreate some of their favourite digital games</strong> using their craft skills. For example, they can recreate a simpler version of the game Untangle Tangle Rope Master, using small hoops or rings, sticks, different colours of strings or ribbons and sturdy cardboard. You can take turns untangling and solving each game set by your opponent.</li>

<p>In a world where children are increasingly immersed in digital media, you must guide them through the complexities of online gaming, social media, and digital content. But first, you need to get familiar with different kinds of ratings and learn how to read different symbols.</p>

<p><strong>Who They&rsquo;re Playing With</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve understood the different types of rating systems and what they mean, have regular conversations with your child about who they&rsquo;re playing with. MMO Game or MMOG (Massive Multi-player Online Game) is a kind of game with large numbers of players on the same server. This means that it isn&rsquo;t always necessary that our child is playing with someone he/she knows in real life. While most games have rules and privacy settings, you should be aware of who your child&rsquo;s online friends are.</p>
<p>Depending on your child&rsquo;s age and the game they&rsquo;re playing you can set a rule or encourage them to play online with relatives and known friends.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Online Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy Settings:</strong> Review social media privacy settings together. And teach older kids and teens how to enable privacy settings. If someone unknown is contacting your child, make sure your child is able to approach you about it. Teach them how they can block people online.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Stress the importance of not sharing personal details online. And advise against sharing location details and personal information.</li>

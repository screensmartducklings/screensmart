<p><strong>Tiny Eyes Big Screens: Digital Screens and Babies</strong></p>
<p>How much screen time is too much screen time? This modern parenting question looms over us. In a digital world where we are reliant on digital screens, being mindful of our babies&rsquo; exposure to screens is a challenging task! The first four years of a child&rsquo;s life are crucial for their cognitive development. Babies and toddlers learn primarily through sensory experiences, social interactions, and physical play. While screens can offer educational content and an opportunity for momentary respite, they are not risk-free. We should be aware of these potential risks and be an informed decision maker for our family&rsquo;s wellbeing.</p>

<p><strong>Screen Time and Developmental Delays</strong></p>
<p>In a comprehensive study (JAMA Pediatrics, 2023) of 7,097 children aged 1 four categories of screen time exposure were identified, ranging from less than 1 to 4 or more hours per day. Researchers studied the impact it had on five domains of development. They found a higher <strong>risk</strong> of developmental delays at age 2 in the communication, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal and social skills domains. Regarding the risk of developmental delay at age 4 years, associations were identified in the communication and problem-solving domains. The risk of developmental delay increased with the <strong>amount of screen time</strong>. For example, for communication at age 2, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.61 for 1 to less than 2 hours per day, increasing to 4.78 for 4 or more hours, compared to less than 1 hour.</p>
<p>Another pivotal study led by psychologist Sheri Madigan, PhD, from the University of Calgary (JAMA Pediatrics 2019), provides valuable insights. The study involved 2,441 mother-child pairs and revealed a concerning <strong>correlation</strong>: increased screen time at 24 and 36 months was linked to poorer performance in behavioural, cognitive, and social development at 36 months. The opposite (poorer development leads to more screen time) was not observed, suggesting that the case wasn&rsquo;t of parents relying on screen time to handle a challenging child. This <strong>suggests</strong> that high screen time could <strong>potentially</strong> be a precursor to developmental difficulties rather than being a response to them.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Interactions: Evidence from Research</strong></p>
<p>For babies under two, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests limiting screen time, with an exception for video chatting. However, even this medium isn't without its complexities. A research (Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 2018) found that when 2-year-olds were assigned to watch a prerecorded video or a live video session (which aimed at teaching children new words) in the presence of their parents, a live video chat kept the kids&rsquo; attention better than a prerecorded video, but only kids whose parents participated alongside them were able to learn new words from the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The basic pattern that has been found in dozens of studies is that children learn better from a person who is with them face-to-face than from a person on a screen, even if it&rsquo;s the exact same person doing the exact same thing,&rdquo; says Georgene Troseth, PhD, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what we can do:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, we should hold ourselves accountable for digital habits in front of our children because they learn from us! For babies aged 0 to 2, we can limit screen use to video chatting and interactive play games only. We can strive for quality over quantity, in instances when we have to set our baby in front of a screen, we can aim to share content that is educational and high in quality (no mind-numbing looped playbacks of C<em>ocomelon</em>). Keeping all of this in mind, we should always <em>always</em> prioritize screen-free and physical play.</p>

<p>It's all about balance and making better choices for our families. While screens are an inevitable part of modern life, their use in the early years of our children's lives should be approached with mindfulness. These studies do not declare that screens <em>will</em> hinder development, rather, they outline potential risk factors we should consider when making decisions for their well-being. We don&rsquo;t want our children glued to the screens for hours per day, and we are trying to prevent just that!</p>

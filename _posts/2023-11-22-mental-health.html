<p><strong>Screen Time &amp; Children&rsquo;s Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>In today's digital world, screens are a ubiquitous part of children's lives. While they offer educational and entertainment value, excessive screen time can have a negative impact on mental health. Since screens are such a big part of our day-to-day lives, you need to understand the different ways it affects us, so that you can decide how much of it is healthy for your child.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Mental Impact of Screen Time</strong></p>
<p>The issue with mobile devices is that they are compelling and can lead to excessive internet browsing, making them a significant timewaster. Their portability and widespread use make them almost indispensable. While adults can recognize and counteract these drawbacks by choosing to limit their phone usage, very young children, such as 2- or 3-year-olds, have no understanding of these concerns. If they have been using phones or tablets since infancy, these devices become a standard part of their lives, increasing their desire to use them even more.</p>
<p><strong>Escalating Screen Time During COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Research conducted by Common Sense Media found a marked increase in screen time among tweens and teens during the pandemic. According to the study, the average screen time for children ages 8 to 12 was five and a half hours. And 32% of the teenagers reported they "wouldn't want to live without" YouTube.&nbsp; The study highlighted concerns over the long hours spent on screens and the overreliance on digital media for entertainment and social interaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Effects on Behaviour, Emotion and Cognition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Behavioural problems such as <strong>hyperactivity</strong>. Parents have reported that after continuous excessive use, they noticed their child to be more hyperactive than before. This could be the result of excessive sedentary behaviour. Kids love to jump, run, and play as it is crucial for their development and fine-tuning their motor skills. If they aren&rsquo;t burning off that energy with play, it might turn into hyperactivity.</li> &nbsp;

<li>A brain feeding on digital media is activated by attractive and engaging stimuli. If this is not portioned in a healthy manner, then in the moments when a child is not engaging with digital media, the child might experience symptoms of <strong>anxiety</strong>.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>The process of the dopamine reward loop gets, essentially, hijacked by digital screens. This creates a constant need to want new and more things. Which is great for short-span video platforms but not so great for us. Especially, for our little ones with yet-to-be-fully-developed brains. And the modern problem of <strong>worsening attention spans</strong> has arisen.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Excessive or compulsive use of digital media, particularly social media, can cause children to have low self-esteem. While everyone does this: only display the good and exciting aspects of your life, we tend to forget that when viewing other people&rsquo;s posts and subsequently comparing ourselves to them. Young adolescents are even more susceptible to it. This then causes <strong>low self-esteem, low mood, and FOMO or the Fear Of Missing Out.</strong></li>
&nbsp;
<li>Digital media can be a window to the world, it lets us learn so much about different people and cultures. But like it&rsquo;s said too much of a good thing is bad for you. When kids start to excessively look at the world through their screens, it taints their reality. The world around them may not be exciting anymore. And when the get bored, and they get bored quickly, they turn towards their screens again. Creativity becomes less necessary when boredom is staunched by screen use. In younger children, this might cause issues with <strong>psychosocial development</strong> as well as <strong>speech and language development</strong>.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Sedentary viewing leads to <strong>little physical activity</strong>. This prolonged inactivity adds another layer of the kinds of mental health issues can may arise. It also causes them to disengage and may affect how they interact with other family members.</li>

&nbsp;
<li>Every school-going child&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; worst nightmare: too much screen time can have a <strong>negative impact on school performance</strong>. This can be due to the reduced attention span, the child simply does not find school engaging enough to pay attention. Additionally, children and teenagers often use digital media at the same time that they're doing other things, such as homework. This on-and-off use is not an effective multi-tasking technique and it can have an influence on their education.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Teenagers&rsquo; displays on social media often show risky behaviours, such as substance use, sexual behaviours, self-injury, or eating disorders. Exposure of teens through media to alcohol, tobacco use, or sexual behaviours is linked to engaging in these activities earlier. You need to be confident in your child&rsquo;s moral strength and his/her sense of cultural identity, that they will not be <strong>influenced by peer pressure</strong>.</li>

&nbsp;
<li>TV viewing may lead to physical inactivity and attention issues, whereas internet use and gaming might support stress management skills.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>The relationship between social media use and <strong>depression</strong> in young people is complex and not fully understood. While some studies suggest a link, others find no significant connection. It is still unsure if more screen use causes depression or do people who are depressed spend more time on their devices. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important that you consider your child's social media usage patterns, and decide if it is a cause for concern.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Excessive screen time can hinder experiential learning and creativity in children. For example, your child will not learn to stack blocks by watching it on a screen. They will learn by touching the blocks, feeling the texture and weight of different materials, and using trial and error to get one to balance on another. This is early problem-solving. So, in addition to limiting screen time, it is important to encourage a child to get involved in experiential learning through play with toys because that fosters early problem-solving and creativity.<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention Over Damage Control</strong></p>
<p>Co-viewing can help you avoid so many types of problems. As child behavioural expert Dr Jennifer Cross puts it: &ldquo;I believe YouTube is generally bad for young children. If left to their own devices, children are often better than their parents at finding their favourite videos that link to other videos and can lead to hours of watching endless clips.&rdquo; The site's minimal regulation means that children can access a wide range of content, some of which might have little educational value or, in the worst cases, be violent or inappropriate. The most effective strategy is for you to watch alongside your children, actively selecting content that is both suitable and educational.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Parents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morning Routine:</strong> Encourage non-screen activities in the morning to set a positive tone for the day.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>The Big Three</strong>: adequate <strong>sleep</strong>, proper <strong>nutrition</strong>, and <strong>regular physical activity</strong>. These are key pillars for brain development and overall health in both children and adults. Excessive screen time can negatively influence these areas. Research indicates that kids with high screen usage often consume more fast food, fewer fruits and vegetables, and experience reduced sleep quality and physical activity. Hence, it's vital to integrate healthy habits into daily routines and consciously moderate screen time to maintain a balanced lifestyle.</li>

&nbsp;
<li><strong>Foster Healthy Habits:</strong> Encourage healthy eating and regular exercise, counteracting the sedentary nature of screen use. Try to include your children in your daily exercise routines. Or make a game out of it, pretend to be your child&rsquo;s gym instructor. This way, they have fun without it feeling like a task.</li>

<br>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Educational and Interactive Content: </strong>When you are busy and you need your child to be quiet, it is very tempting to hand them a phone or a tablet. Instead, choose educational shows that encourage interaction and learning, and play them on the TV.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Monitor Content and Usage:</strong> Be aware of what your children are watching and how long they spend on screens.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Limit Accessibility:</strong> Control access to mobile devices, especially for very young children. This means being aware of how you use your phones around them.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Establish Screen-Free Times:</strong> Designate certain times of the day like mealtime, and especially before bedtime, as screen-free.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Open Communication:</strong> Talk to your children about their online experiences and feelings.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> If you notice signs of anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues, consult a healthcare professional.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As parents, steering through the complex world of digital media with your children requires a nuanced approach. Recognizing how screen time can affect their mental health is fundamental. Adopt strategies that reduce negative impacts and promote a harmonious balance in their lives. The aim isn't to completely remove screen usage but to integrate it in a manner that enhances your child's overall health and happiness.</p>

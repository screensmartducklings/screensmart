<p><strong>Setting a Routine: Dos and Don&rsquo;ts </strong></p>
<p>Managing digital media use can be finnicky. Ask anyone who has tried to cut unproductive screen use out of their daily lives: it is not as easy as it seems. Routines can help minimise conflict about screen time. To find a balance between screen time and screen-free time, there are some rules and habits that you can integrate in your family&rsquo;s routine to help everyone, especially your children, to be healthy screen users.</p>
<p><strong>Be Realistic</strong></p>
<p>Creating a rigid and strict regimen will do you no favours. Digital media and screens are awesome, and most platforms are designed specifically for you to keep coming back to it! There are an estimated 210 million people worldwide who have suffered from social media and internet addiction (Science Direct, 2017), this means that we need to be vigilant, but within reason. Remember, your child is just that - a child! Kids make mistakes, they rebel, they get fixated on things, and they get distracted. Be patient in your approach, come from a place of empathy. We want to be a voice of reason for them, a voice of reason that they listen to!</p>
<p><strong>Time Limits</strong></p>
<p>Screens are multi-functional, so it&rsquo;s a smart step to distinguish between productive screen time and leisure. There are many medical organisations that have published screen time limits and guidelines for children, these are a good starting point for those who are unsure about how much screen time is too much. More importantly, you need to listen to the needs of your child. Every child is unique, and every family dynamic is unique. Your child&rsquo;s leisure screen time limits can be one hour or two, depending on the kind of media. If you&rsquo;re worried their screen use is unhealthy, be realistic when you&rsquo;re aiming to reduce their screen time. You can treat it like a bad habit. Instead of a total ban, start by gradually reducing their current screen time.</p>
<p><strong>What is Leisure Screen Time for Your Child?</strong></p>
<p>Define what leisure screen time means for your family. When allowing leisure screen use, make intentional selections about the kind of media you want them to consume. For example, if they&rsquo;re going to watch videos on YouTube, decide which channels are age and content appropriate for your child. Videos that teach children the alphabet, or numbers are better than letting them watch cartoons that might promote ill- behaviour, or the content does not match your cultural morals and identity. While you cannot control the recommendation feed, the type of channels you&rsquo;re subscribed to, and what kind of content you&rsquo;re viewing will generally reflect in what the algorithm recommends to you. Leisure screen time may also include playing games on a mobile phone, tablet or on a gaming device like Play Station. Based on the kind of games that they&rsquo;re playing, talk to them and set a time limit that they can respect and maintain most of the time. But for babies and toddlers aged 0-2, the evidence is strong that screens aren&rsquo;t effective at teaching, and they could displace the kinds of face-to-face interactions that help young kids learn. It&rsquo;s safe to say that you should avoid passive screen time for kids this age as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>When is Leisure Screen Time Allowed?</strong></p>
<p>You might decide your child can watch TV or use the tablet, but only between certain time periods. Or your routine might include just one program before dinner, or whatever suits your family. Some kids come home tired from school and have no energy to talk to anyone and prefer to be given space until they are recharged to properly interact again. While some prefer some space after finishing their homework or after an intense study session. You can allow your child to view passively during similar moments in their routine life. For toddlers, who might not have routines like these, it is best to be very careful when you&rsquo;re letting them view media passively. Avoid handing them screens during tantrums or emotional meltdowns, as this may turn into a habit. While distracting them with screens is a tempting and easy thing to do, be mindful of the potential issues this may lead to in the long run. When setting these rules, factor in a different schedule for the weekends. How much are they allowed during weekends and holidays? You can also try to have weekly tech-free days. For example, on weekends you can plan fun games and activities for your family, or you can have tech free days until sundown during the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>The Bedtime Rule: No Screens Before Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Have a bedtime routine set for them, so while you may be busy clearing the house after dinner or with chores, they can continue with their routine. Kids who are not sleeping by themselves, who either sleep with their parents or don&rsquo;t sleep until someone tucks them in, might feel bored after dinner and turn to screens to pass the post-dinner time. This routine may include things like praying <em>dua</em>, doing <em>tasbeeh</em>, preparing their school bag for the next day, changing their clothes, or for toddlers, you can include them in the house chores or assign them a small task. For example, they can arrange the fridge magnets every night, or they can be told to scavenger hunt the house for tiny bits of paper and tissue and other trash that they collect and hand them over to you for disposal. Try your best to prevent the habit of passively watching videos or scrolling until they&rsquo;re ready for bed. It's a great idea to have a no-screen time rule before bedtime. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) suggests no screens for two hours before bedtime. This helps kids wind down, makes it easier for them to fall asleep, and ensures they wake up refreshed. Studies suggest that blue light can disrupt the circadian rhythm, our sleep cycle. So, keeping devices out of the bedtime routine is a good move. To assist this, you can have a family rule of bedrooms being a screen-free zone, or a mobile-and-tablet-free zone during bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>Screen Free Zones and Family Rules</strong></p>
<p>Family rules around screen use are essential. It is important that every member of the family respects these basic rules so that the children also respect these rules. You might want to discuss and set guidelines on when screens can be used. In addition to what has been discussed, meals can be completely screen-free, this includes no television playing in the background, as well as no mobile phones in the dinner area. Minimize the influence of TV in the home. Avoid installing a TV or computer in your child&rsquo;s bedroom. This might physically isolate family members and decrease interaction. Moreover, children who have TVs in their room tend to spend almost 1.5 hours more in a typical day watching TV than their peers without one in their room. There is no better way than to teach by example. You can have a positive influence on your children simply by making regular, screen-free time for your own activities and family activities, like walking, reading, eating, or just talking. This not only offers alternative forms of entertainment but also emphasizes the importance of family time. This teaches them values like you can enjoy yourself and have fun without screens and that family time and engagement is one of the most important ways to spend time your time. You also need to be conscious that when your children are talking to you give them your full attention. Avoid texting or scrolling when they&rsquo;re asking you something. If they&rsquo;re interrupting something important, explain to them that you need a minute before you can attend to them.</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Hobbies and Interests</strong></p>
<p>Screens can be a way of getting to know your child. Pay attention to his/her interests and hobbies. There are so many apps and websites developed catering to different interests and for different age groups. For example, if they are into art, they can use a drawing app, or follow tutorials on YouTube and other social media. The idea is to integrate screen use with their hobbies, making screen time more productive and aligned with their passions. This also promotes healthy interactions between you and your child and enriches your relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Self-Regulation</strong></p>
<p>Teach children to self-regulate their screen time. Avoid micro-managing their screen use, this might hinder this development. Kids become engrossed and often do not realize how much time has passed. Instead, set clear expectations and communicate it to them, give them a reminder of how much time they have left and what they&rsquo;re to do next.<br /> Keeping It Balanced Remember, it's about balance. Screen time isn't inherently bad; it's about how it's used. As one parent puts it, "I look at screen time as part of a bigger picture of activities my son has access to. We go to groups, go for walks, play at the park, play with toys, read, sing, do puzzles etc &ndash; so I don&rsquo;t worry too much about his screen time as it isn&rsquo;t his only activity.&rdquo; Ensure your child has a variety of activities &ndash; from group activities to solo play, from outdoor adventures to quiet time with screens.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency Across Settings</strong></p>
<p>Consider how screen time rules apply in different settings, like when visiting friends or relatives. Communicate your family rules to others and share ideas for family-friendly digital content. Discussions at parent meetings can also be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, managing screen time is about setting a routine that works for your family, balancing digital and non-digital activities, and leading by example. It's about making screen time one of many activities that contribute to your child's growth and development. By setting these routines and guidelines, you&rsquo;re not just limiting screen time; you're opening a world of other enriching experiences that can help your child thrive in the digital age and beyond.</p>

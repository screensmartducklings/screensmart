<p>Just like young ducklings rely on their mother's oil gland for waterproofing until they grow feathers, our children also depend on us to guide and protect them in the digital world. Here are some ways to ensure they stay "waterproof" in the ever-flowing stream of screens and technology:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Customized Screen Time Routines:</b> It's common to reach for our phones when we come home after a long day or when we're relaxing after an event. These moments of downtime can become opportunities for our children to observe our screen habits.</li>
    <li><b>Co-Watching and Interacting:</b>Whenever possible, co-watch or co-play with your children as they engage with media. This provides an opportunity for you to discuss content, answer questions, and share your values.</li>
    <li><b>Awareness of Dangerous Behavior:</b>Teach your children about the types of dangerous online behavior they may encounter, such as cyberbullying, online predators, or scams. Encourage them to immediately report anything suspicious.</li>
    <li><b>Online Etiquette:</b>Help your kids understand the importance of online etiquette, including being respectful in digital interactions, avoiding oversharing personal information, and using proper language.</li>
    <li><b>Parental Controls:</b>Learn to use and implement parental control tools and software to limit access to age-appropriate content and monitor screen time.</li>
    <li><b>Content Review:</b>Take an active role in finding good quality content for your children and review media for child safety. Familiarize yourself with media ratings to make informed choices.</li>
    <li><b>Family Media Plan:</b>Create a family media plan that everyone in the household follows. For example, designate meal times as screen-free moments, with no exceptions.</li>
    <li><b>Productive Screen Time:</b>Encourage productive screen time activities, such as educational apps, creative content creation, or interactive learning platforms.</li>
    <li><b>Screen Time Tracking:</b>Utilize screen time tracking features on devices to monitor and manage your child's digital usage.</li>
    <li><b>Active Screen Time:</b>Promote active screen time by engaging in physical activities that involve screens, like interactive video games that require movement or watching exercise videos together.</li>
    <li><b>Privacy Education:</b>Teach your children about online privacy, emphasizing the importance of not sharing personal information like home addresses or phone numbers online.</li>
    <li><b>Healthy Sedentary Screen Time:</b>Make sedentary screen time healthier by setting time limits and encouraging regular breaks for physical activity, stretching, and eye rest.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just as mother ducks nurture their ducklings until they are ready to be independent, our guidance and support in managing screen time and digital technology will help our children become responsible and safe digital citizens when the time comes for them to navigate the digital world on their own.</p>

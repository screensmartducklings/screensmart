<p style="font-weight: 400;">The video "Fix Your Focus" by Answer in Progress addresses the pervasive issue of declining attention spans, particularly due to the myriad of distractions that invade our lives, especially those caused my technology. The creator shares personal struggles with maintaining focus and offers a detailed exploration of strategies on trying to reclaim control over attention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first step of resolving every problem is accepting that there is a problem. Just like the creator realized and expressed her frustration over the inability to focus and the constant cravings for digital distractions, like scrolling passively on social media. If you&rsquo;re here, then you&rsquo;re probably experiencing something similar, a lack of control over attention, which is affecting your productivity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One unique layer the creator adds to her video, is her use of EEG or electroencephalogram manufactured by a company called EMOTIV, which tracks brain activity related to attention, excitement, and stress. She combines this data with her screen time metrics and offers a comprehensive view for the viewers. Although this isn&rsquo;t a proper scientific trail or study, it&rsquo;s scientific enough for her to know how she reacts to distractions, what her brain activity looks like throughout the day, and by doing this she makes an unexpected discovery.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over three days, the creator tracks phone pickups, computer productivity, and EEG metrics. The findings reveal that genuine engagement occurs only for about 12% of the day, highlighting a significant distraction problem. Moments of deep focus are rare and often disrupted by the temptation to check the phone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To figure out the crux of the issue, she reads various books on focus and attention and summarises three main concepts that recur in most of them. Which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attention vs. Focus: Attention can be understood as an overall general awareness, and focus happens when you control and concentrate this awareness on a specific task.</li>
<li>Focus is Finite: It&rsquo;s a limited and exhaustible resource, so you must use it accordingly.</li>
<li>Distractions Drain Focus: The cost of filtering out distractions while performing a task depletes your focus, making your focus even more limited and less effective.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To manage her distractions, she uses the following tactics: deleting unimportant apps, setting screen time limits for frequently used apps, turning off notifications, using an app that changes the app icons to plain text and switching the phone&rsquo;s display to grayscale. All of these tactics are amongst one of the most common advices that go around the internet. Many others have shared that they noticed a weird kind of muscle memory or habit. In the initial days after deleting the apps, they would instinctively go to the spot on their screen where that app used to be, only to realise after a second that they&rsquo;ve deleted the app. This just shows how deeply imbedded the notion of using these apps for distraction is. Scrolling on social media while you want to take a break from work becomes second nature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Turning off notifications is also pretty effective. Most devices have a feature where you can choose from your contact list, whose notifications are allowed, which apps are you allowing. So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re distracted whenever there&rsquo;s a text on a group chat, and like most of us, you&rsquo;re a part of a lot of group chats, then instead of just muting the entire app, you can choose whose notifications you want to let through. It&rsquo;s a common experience, you pick up the phone to answer a text message and unknowingly end up spending an hour scrolling or playing a game!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The last two tactics used by the creator is to simply make the phone less appealing and exciting to use. You can also try tying a hairband around your screen, this creates a small nuisance which might either serve as a reminder to not get distracted, or make it more irritating to use.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After doing all of this, the creator of this video thought she&rsquo;d be all set to be her most productive self, and while these changes resulted in a noticeable reduction in phone usage, she discovered a new kind of distraction that was within herself, random thoughts that disrupts focus. To resolve this, she uses a notebook to jot down distracting thoughts for later review. She also adopts timeboxing, scheduling specific tasks throughout the day based on energy levels and focus requirements. This approach helps reduce multitasking and optimize productivity. While going through her EEG readings she discovered that when she was performing tasks she actually enjoys, her attention levels peaked. You&rsquo;re less likely to get distracted when you&rsquo;re doing a task you enjoy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a cog in this system, sometimes you relapse and go back to your old (bad) habits. After maintaining a solid schedule and increasing productivity, the creator crashed and burned. Spending a whole day unable to do anything and instead scrolling aimlessly on her phone. She realised that in order to sustain this new lifestyle, she needs to have her internal monologue sorted. Despite initial scepticism, the creator turns to meditation using the Headspace app, which offers guided sessions for beginners. Over time, meditation proves beneficial, improving EEG-measured metrics for engagement, excitement, and stress. The practice helps balance focus by reducing extreme peaks and troughs in attention. To her, meditation helps you to pay attention to your attention, instead of being focused on quantifying productivity. Meditation is considered an MBI or Mindfulness Based Intervention. It&rsquo;s a kind of open monitoring, where you observe your surroundings without reacting to it. Research indicates that meditation can enhance attention, though results vary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the creator concludes that while productivity tips are helpful, they often provide only temporary relief. Meditation, however, cultivates a more resilient focus, capable of enduring distractions. The video emphasizes that maintaining focus requires a combination of managing external distractions and strengthening internal focus through practices like meditation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone looking to curb screen time and enhance focus, this video offers valuable insights and practical solutions. By combining data-driven analysis with mindfulness techniques, the creator provides a holistic approach to improving attention spans in a digitally distracted world. While distractions can be limited, life always doesn&rsquo;t play by your rules. We live in a fluid world, things happen, lifestyles change. In the end, what we have is our core ability to focus.</p>

<p><strong>Screen Time Concerns: When Should You Worry?</strong></p>
<p>As a parent in today's digital world, you're often faced with a challenging question: When should I be concerned about my child's screen use? This question doesn't have a one-size-fits-all answer, but with a bit of insight and guidance, you can navigate this aspect of parenting with more confidence and understanding. If you feel that screen use is negatively affecting any of the following factors, it may be a sign that you need to help them moderate their screen use.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Healthy Digital Habits</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sleep and Physical Health:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Check if your child is getting enough restful sleep. Screens emit blue light, which can interfere with sleep patterns. For example, on weekend or holidays, is passive scrolling/ viewing the first thing they want to do when they wake up? Are they trying to stay awake past their bedtime because they want to watch videos? If you notice other changes brought about by screen use, consider altering their screen habits.</li>

<br>
<br>
<li>Observe their physical health. Excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, impacting physical well-being. This might look like having a bad posture all the time, neck pain, dry eyes or blurry eyes caused by eye strain, and lack of energy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Mental and Emotional Health:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Notice any changes in behaviour that may indicate they are being affected by online interactions. While unhealthy passive viewing can have a negative impact on their mental well-being, there might be a more serious issue like online bullying, fallout with an online friend etc.</li>

<br>
<br>
<li>Gauge their emotional state. Are they showing signs of anxiety or depression? Sometimes, excessive screen use can contribute to these issues. Other signs to look out for are increased irritability, angry outbursts, and constant reoccurring low moods. To counter this you can limit their online activity or interact with them. For instance, you might notice your child&rsquo;s improved mood after replacing an hour of screen time with family board games or other activity that they enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Academic Engagement:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Monitor their school performance. Is screen time distracting them from homework or studies?</li>
<li>Ensure they are not using devices excessively during study time. To do so, try to make their study spaces device free. If they are using smaller screens like mobile phones for academic reasons, try to screen mirror the phone&rsquo;s display to a larger screen like a TV. This combats the eye strain we experience while reading on the mobile phone as well as they are less likely to get distracted by other apps in the mobile phone.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Social Connections:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Observe how they interact with family and friends. While they might be a part of an online community of people with similar interests, or they may have online friends, are they also maintaining healthy offline relationships?</li>
<li>Understand how they use technology to connect with others. Is it supplementing their social life or replacing face-to-face interactions?</li>
<li>In social settings, or during a family picnic, or outdoor programs, are they busy playing games or watching videos when it isn&rsquo;t okay for them to do so? Try to actively involve them in the setting and teach by example by not using your devices passively as well. While some functions might just be for &ldquo;grownups&rdquo;, considering your child&rsquo;s likes and interests, and if it&rsquo;s appropriate, you can bring along toys, activity sheets or books etc. to help them not supplement their boredom with screens.</li>

<br>
<br>
</ul>
<li><strong>Diverse Interests:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Encourage a variety of hobbies and interests, both online and offline.</li>
<li>Limit passive/ leisure screen time to ensure they have time to explore other activities.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Promote daily physical activity. Balance screen time with active play and outdoor activities.</li>

<br>
</ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Screen Time:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Assess the content they are consuming. Is it educational, age-appropriate, and adds value?</li>
<li>Be involved in choosing apps, games, and programs that are beneficial. Talk to them about what they&rsquo;re watching. With a combination of co-watching and conversations, be aware of the type of platform they&rsquo;re using as well as the contents.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Building a Healthy Relationship with Technology</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding Your Child&rsquo;s Technology Use:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Have open conversations about how and why they use digital technology.</li>
<li>Show interest in their online activities and ask them to teach you about their favourite games or apps.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Setting Boundaries and Guidelines:<br /></strong>The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) sets the following limit guidelines for parents.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>For children under 18 months, limit screen use to video chatting.</li>
<li>Between 18 and 24 months, focus on educational content with a caregiver.</li>
<li>For children aged 2-5, restrict non-educational screen time to about 1 hour on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends.</li>
<li>For older children, instil healthy habits and limit excessive screen use.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Role of Family in Digital Habits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Practice screen-free family meals and outings to encourage real-world interactions.</li>
<li>Use parental controls to manage content and screen time effectively.</li>
<li>Avoid using screens as a means to calm or distract your child in place of direct interaction.</li>

<p><strong>Recognizing the Risks</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Media and Teenagers:<br /></strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of how social media usage can affect teenagers. Excessive use can displace critical activities such as in-person socializing or sleep.</li>
<li>Encourage a balance between online interaction and real-life relationships.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Developing Strategies for Healthy Use:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Teach your child about setting limits on social media to avoid anxiety related to instant responses or constant connectivity.</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of digital footprints and the importance of online privacy and safety.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Navigating is about understanding your children&rsquo;s needs, interests, and the impact of digital technology on their overall well-being. By taking a proactive approach and setting clear guidelines, you can help your child develop a healthy relationship with technology, ensuring that it adds value to their life rather than detracting from it. Remember, every child is unique. While you should consider health association&rsquo;s guidelines, your approach should be tailored to your child&rsquo;s individual needs and circumstances.</p>

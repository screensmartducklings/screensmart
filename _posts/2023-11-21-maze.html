<p><strong>The Social Media Maze: A Parent's Roadmap</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Likes, hashtags, and reposts, navigating the world of social media as a parent can often feel like walking through a maze. Since online profiles are now seen as an extension of our identities, how we present ourselves in the online scape is equally important. Although social media gets a bad rep, it is a beneficial resource if we utilize it in the right way.</p>
<p><strong>Smartphone &amp; Social Media Readiness</strong></p>
<p>While social media can be accessed through a PC or a tablet, phones are largely the preferred choice. What makes phone use compulsive compared to other screens/ activities like TV or gaming, is that phones are mobile. You can carry them in your pocket, put it by your bedside, bring them along with you wherever you go, and never part with it. If you are planning to buy your child a phone, or allow them to create a social media profile, here are some of the things you need to be sure of before you do that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they responsible enough? Do you trust that they have a level of maturity and sensibility to have access to social media?</li>
<li>How confident are you that they&rsquo;ll be able to respect and maintain the boundaries you have set for them?</li>
<li>Are you worried that mobile phones might displace important activities? How do you plan on enforcing your boundaries?</li>
<li>How would you teach them new communication manners and make sure that they don&rsquo;t partake in bullying or insulting others? Compared to face-to-face interactions, there is a distance created in digital interactions and sometimes two people might not even know each other. This makes it easier to pick fights and possibly become aggressive.</li>
<li>Regular check-ins about your child&rsquo;s digital life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guidelines and Boundaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When are they allowed to use it? Do they have total access to their phones and social media accounts? Or are they accessing their profiles through a tablet or a home computer?</li>
<li>Where are they allowed to use? You may have rules such as they can only access their accounts in family rooms and not in their bedroom. Or you may have a family rule of having screen-free dinners.</li>
<li>Who are they following? Can they only follow known friends and family? If they&rsquo;re following internet personalities, are their content and language child-friendly?</li>
<li>You can have &lsquo;time-outs&rsquo; you can use once a week if you feel like your child is becoming too engrossed. But don&rsquo;t use these &lsquo;time-outs&rsquo; as punishment. Instead, make sure you&rsquo;re explaining why you&rsquo;re calling for a time-out and why it&rsquo;s justified so that your child respects it, and it does not create a conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Media Platforms 101</strong></p>
<p>There are so many social media platforms out there. Here are some of the most popular and widely used ones that you should know about to avoid feeling like an ancient being when your child mentions them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong>: A photo-and-video-sharing social networking service, Instagram allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter or X</strong>: This platform is known for its microblogging and social networking service, where users post and interact with messages known as "tweets." Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Facebook is a platform where individuals can create free profiles to connect with friends, coworkers, and even strangers online. It enables users to share various forms of content such as photos, music, videos, articles, and their personal thoughts and opinions with a wide audience of their choosing.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok</strong>: This is a short-form-video-sharing app that allows users to create and share videos, on any topic. TikTok is a social media app, but unlike other competitors like Instagram, users share videos instead of photos.</li>
<li><strong>Snapchat</strong>: A multimedia messaging app, Snapchat is popular for its unique feature: pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. If they take a screenshot or save a &lsquo;snap&rsquo;, the sender is notified of that activity.</li>
<li><strong>BeReal</strong>: A photo sharing-app, BeReal prompts users to simultaneously take and share one photo with their phone's front and back cameras at a random time once a day. It aims to encourage authentic, unfiltered sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>: Known as the "front page of the internet," Reddit is a network of communities based on people's interests. It's a platform for asking questions, sharing news, and fostering discussions on a myriad of topics.</li>
<li><strong>Discord</strong>: Initially designed for the gaming community, Discord has evolved into a general-use platform for all types of communities. It specializes in text, image, video, and audio communication between users in a chat channel.</li>
<li><strong>Twitch</strong>: Primarily a live streaming platform, Twitch is focused on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of eSports competitions, in addition to music broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong>: A photo-and-video-sharing, and social media service designed to enable saving and discovery of information on the internet using images, and, on a smaller scale, animated GIFs and videos, in the form of pinboards.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp</strong>: A freeware, cross-platform messaging, and Voice over IP (VoIP) service, WhatsApp allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media.</li>
<li><strong>Telegram</strong>: A cloud-based instant messaging, video calling, and VoIP service, Telegram offers end-to-end encrypted video calling, VoIP, file sharing, and several other features. It prides itself on its security features.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Understanding Social Media Risks &amp; Safety</strong></p>
<p>Children on social media may face several risks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit or Inappropriate Media</strong>: While these platforms are moderated and they have community guidelines in place to avoid exposure to inappropriate content, there is still a chance of unintentionally coming across such media. You should be open with your child about these things, and make sure you let them know that they can and should talk to you if they&rsquo;re coming across any post or comment that makes them uncomfortable, or they&rsquo;re confused about.</li>
<li><strong>Spam Messages</strong>: Most platforms have privacy settings on who can send you a direct message or a &lsquo;DM&rsquo;. But on almost every platform, users who aren&rsquo;t following you, or vice versa, can send you a DM request. These can be harmless, or they can have links to other malicious websites. Your child should know not to trust them and to never click on a link sent by random strangers on the internet. Spammers sometimes target children with click-baits like &rsquo;10 lucky winners have a chance to get the brand-new Play Station. Click the link to know more&rsquo;, kids can get easily influenced to check it out.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Thefts and Account Hacking</strong>: In some instances, individuals may impersonate others, such as mutual friends, with the intention of requesting photos or addresses under the guise of sending gifts. It's essential for your child to exercise caution before sharing any personal information. A general guideline is that if an account claiming to be someone known asks for money or banking details, it's important not to trust them until you can confirm it is the actual person and that they&rsquo;re safe. Additionally, if someone requests information that they should already have, like a mobile number or address, it's advisable not to disclose that information to them.</li>
<li><strong>Cyberbullying</strong>: As mentioned earlier, cyberbullying is a prevalent issue. Sometimes there is nothing you can do to prevent the initial aggression. But your child should know that they can come to you if it happens. Be gentle and kind, they might be getting hateful messages from someone you had warned against earlier and had advised not to interact with. In such cases, do not blame your child or scold them with the classic &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo;. Talk to the bully&rsquo;s family members, take screenshots for proof, and report the account to the platform for breaking community guidelines- the platform may send them a warning, take down their post or comment, or temporarily suspend their account. In serious cases, do not hesitate to contact local authorities for assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Misinformation</strong>: Social media is rampant with misinformation about all kinds of topics like medicine, health care, politics, etc. There&rsquo;s a high likelihood of your child coming across it. Encourage media literacy and critical thinking. Make sure your child knows that just because something is shared in a professional tone, or it has a lot of likes and views, or it seems to be true does not mean it is. You can teach them this by sharing something false you came across, how you had your doubts about it, and how dangerous it would have been if you had believed it.</li>
<li><strong>Misuse of your content</strong>: Before you or your child post their faces online, make sure you are 100% confident in doing that. Although it does not happen to everyone, atrocities are committed online. People can misuse it, and with the advent of editing technology, they can edit your photos and videos to depict whatever they want. By nature, once something is posted on the internet, it stays there, even if you delete or &lsquo;private&rsquo; your posts. So be aware of this reality and make your decisions accordingly. If you decide against posting, you can make sure other family members and friends respect your choice.</li>
<li><strong>Misuse of Personal Information</strong>: Be wary of sharing personal information like your full legal name, or your birth date. There are many ways people can use this information for identity theft.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media &lsquo;Addiction&rsquo;</strong>: The truth is that social media platforms are designed to keep your attention for as long and as frequently as they can. Social media can be addictive, but that is by design. To counteract this, you yourself need to have a balanced approach and teach your child to balance their use as well. You can use apps and screen time restriction features to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital Parenting </strong></p>
<p>Your child can learn how to be a good internet user by learning from your example. Be a role model to them and set a positive example. Here are some ways you can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask before sharing</strong>. If you&rsquo;re sharing a family photo online, once your child is old enough, ask before you share their image. This teaches them the importance of respecting someone&rsquo;s privacy and it also shows them how you respect theirs.</li>
<li><strong>Be kind</strong>. If you come across a mean comment posted on your page, use this as a teaching opportunity to show how you can be graceful, and how to deal with negativity without being rude.</li>
<li><strong>Follow each other on social media platforms</strong>. This way your child can learn from your posting habits, and you can interact with them by sharing funny memes, and things your child is interested in. This can provide you with context and examples to have open discussions with your child about social media. You can encourage them to share experiences with you as well.</li>
<li><strong>Be honest and smart</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t want your child to be interacting with something, don&rsquo;t just say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to them. Kids are rebellious and they will find a way to do things without you knowing. So be honest and explain why you feel this may be harmful.</li>
<li><strong>Create a joint account</strong>. If you are unsure about a solo social media profile, most platforms allow login on multiple devices. Consider making a joint social media account to familiarize your child with social media in a controlled environment before they have their own account.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss with your child about the permanence of online content</strong> and how it shapes their online reputation. And that they should be comfortable with their online activities in the long term. Similarly, be mindful about what you post about your child. Do not post things that they will find to be humiliating when they&rsquo;re older.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use phones and media as an emotional crutch or a cure for boredom</strong>. Be active and creative in your daily activities. If your child sees that you or other family members use their phones to doom scroll when they&rsquo;re bored or tired, your child will do the same. Make sure when your family is together, they are interacting with the people around them instead of their screens. Boredom is totally fine. Let your child get bored and let them figure out a way to entertain themselves without using screens.</li>
<li><strong>Promote the benefits of social media</strong>. Social media can be a place for educating yourself about new cultures, stories, and life experiences. It can be a tool for learning new skills and acquiring new hobbies. It can be a place for connecting with like-minded people with whom you share your interests. There are so many cool things your child can do online, make sure they explore these new avenues as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parental Controls and Safety Tactics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the passwords private and make sure your child is careful about it too.</li>
<li>Avoid using your accounts on public Wi-Fi. Generally, they are not as safe as private Wi-Fi.</li>
<li>Avoid using <strong>surveillance apps and content filters</strong>. This sends a message that you do not trust your child, and they will find a way to bypass the encryptions. They might not share about ill-content or any other harmful events as they may have accessed things using unfiltered surfing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Educate yourself and learn about <strong>media literacy</strong>. This will guide you to be smart and critical of media, in recognising misleading or sensational content and you will be more adept at guiding your family.</li>
<li>Use <strong>parental controls</strong>! Learn how to tailor a platform&rsquo;s privacy settings to suit your family&rsquo;s privacy needs.</li>

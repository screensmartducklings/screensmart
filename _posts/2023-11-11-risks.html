<p><strong>Understanding Online Risks: A Parent's Guide to Protecting Children in the Digital World</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In an age where children are growing up &lsquo;digital&rsquo;, it's vital for parents to ensure their online safety. This article comprehensively discusses the risks children ages 6 to 12 are likely to encounter and explores practical strategies and tools to help your child stay safe online, while still enjoying the benefits of digital media.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Online Risks for Different Age Groups</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ages 6 to 9: Exploring with Caution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong>: Children are at risk of coming across things that they might find upsetting, disgusting or otherwise uncomfortable. This might include adult content in games or movies, images of cruelty to animals, and real or simulated violence. Kids in this age group tend to use the internet for online gaming as well as surfing the web, therein lies the risk of unintentionally coming across ads that are visually provocative and highly inappropriate for them.</li>
<li><strong>Cyberbullying and Online Harassment</strong>: Children can be targets of bullying by peers or even strangers online, which can have a significant impact on their mental health.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Leaks</strong>: Children may come into contact with unknown people or with adults posing as children online. They might be persuaded to share personal information with strangers. Or they may end up providing contact details after clicking on pop-up messages. There&rsquo;s also a chance of having personal information unknowingly collected by apps and websites can put children at risk of identity theft or unwanted contact.</li>
<li><strong>Addictive Behaviours:</strong> Excessive use of digital media can lead to patterns of addictive behaviour, where children become overly reliant on technology for entertainment or social interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to Advertising and Consumerism</strong>: Children are often exposed to targeted advertising, which can influence their desires and attitudes towards material possessions.</li>
<li><strong>Access to Misinformation</strong>: The risk of encountering false or misleading information, which can shape their understanding of the world inaccurately. For example, children may believe any misinformation spread, willingly or otherwise, by internet personalities they like, follow or subscribe to.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate Development of Other Interests</strong>: Excessive screen time can limit children's exploration and development of other interests and talents, staunching their creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Misconduct: </strong>Children may act in ways that hurt others. For example, they saw a video where one child &lsquo;pranks&rsquo; someone by violent or hurtful actions which is portrayed to be funny and playful. Children may be influenced by that kind of behaviour and act accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Misinformed Actions: </strong>Children may unknowingly make an in-app purchase, or sign and agree to membership or subscription agreements. Or children might be using a toy, app or device with weak internet security, which leaves them open to identity theft or fraud.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ages 10 to 12: Navigating Complex Interactions</strong></p>
<p>As children grow, risks evolve to include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increased Exposure to Cyberbullying</strong>: As social media and online gaming become more prevalent, the risk of cyberbullying and online harassment intensifies.</li>
<li><strong>Communication: </strong>They may be communicating with people through in-game chat or messaging platforms like Discord, where identities remain anonymous. As a result, children might: be open to identity theft or fraud, get inappropriate digital marketing messages or scam messages, have their personal or family data collected, agree to buy things, or pay money without realising.</li>
<li><strong>Online Predators and Grooming</strong>: Older children might be more targeted by online predators due to their increased online presence and social interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate Content:</strong> They may come across material that they might find upsetting, disgusting or otherwise uncomfortable, especially if they see it accidentally. This material might include sexually explicit content in videos, movies, online games or adult visuals and imagery, real or simulated violence, content that&rsquo;s designed to shock or scare, harmful user-generated content, like sites about drug use, self-harm, suicide or negative body image, misinformation, and fake news.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to Radicalization and Extremist Views</strong>: Children may come across radical or extremist content as they explore broader topics online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Risk of Scams and Phishing</strong>: As they become more active online, they may be more susceptible to online scams and phishing attempts.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Pressures</strong>: Pressure to conform to social media trends, which can affect self-esteem and body image, becomes more pronounced.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Unhealthy Comparisons</strong>: Social media can lead to unhealthy comparisons with peers or celebrities, affecting mental health.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Privacy</strong>: As they share more online, the erosion of their privacy becomes a significant concern.</li>
<li><strong>Influence of Digital Advertising: </strong>More sophisticated understanding of and susceptibility to digital advertising, including in-app purchases and microtransactions.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Risk of Digital Footprint Mismanagement:</strong> Lack of awareness about the long-term impact of their online activities on their digital footprint.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Measures for Parents</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technology Introduction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Pressure for Early Introduction:</strong> Avoid the urge to introduce technology too early. Children are quick learners when it comes to digital devices, so don&rsquo;t worry whether they will be able to catch up or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand </strong><strong>Media Types:</strong> Determine what type and how much media is appropriate for your child and set consistent limits on media use. Consider which devices your child will have access to and whether they are shared as a family or belong to your child.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Educating and Empowering</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role Modeling:</strong> You&rsquo;ve been, knowingly or unknowingly, teaching them so much by role-modeling. Try to do the same by demonstrating responsible internet use. Have open discussions about online content, make them aware of what online reputation is and how they should be good online citizens, and about handling online privacy and purchases. Some multi-player games have live chat or live call feature where players can talk to each other while playing. It&rsquo;s smart to teach your child not to do or say anything online that they wouldn&rsquo;t do or say face-to-face to someone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Response:</strong> Always be open and responsive, teach your child to approach you if they encounter upsetting content and discuss how to react positively to online risks. Children are inquisitive by nature; it is much healthier and safer for them to be able to approach you or other elder members of the family when they have doubts and questions rather than taking advice from and listening to strangers who may have malintent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Co-Watching and Monitoring</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Participation:</strong> Select and co-view media with your child, fostering an environment where media is used for learning and creativity. This way you can act quickly and reassure your child if they&rsquo;re upset by something they&rsquo;ve seen online. Ask them questions about their favourite shows, show interest in their games and ask them to teach you one of them and play with them when you can.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Content Choices:</strong> Look for TV shows, movies, and online videos that align with your moral identity, have positive messages about relationships, family and lifestyle, and have inclusive messages about disability, gender, race, and culture, inspire new off-screen play ideas for children once they&rsquo;ve finished watching, have interesting stories that feature kind and respectful characters, and are age appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Vigilant of Watch Histories:</strong> While co-watching is ideal, it&rsquo;s not always feasible. Keep an eye on your child&rsquo;s watch history to stay informed about their viewing habits.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website Safety:</strong> To avoid paying for a game or a movie, children may be tempted to pirate the content online. Teach your children about the risks of using pirating websites. They are, generally, not regulated and they have tracking &lsquo;cookies&rsquo; that may collect personal information, track your child&rsquo;s online activity, or even hack into your child&rsquo;s device. Tracking data has become very sophisticated, and your child may be unaware of the damage until it is too late. Lastly, be aware that even though a site or app is appropriate for young children, the advertising it shows might not be.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health and Safety Checks:</strong> Regularly review, via your peers or online, your children&rsquo;s media used to ensure their safety and well-being. There are websites that specify which scenes might be inappropriate and describe the scene for parents so they may make an informed decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules Outside the Home: </strong>Check other parents&rsquo; internet safety rules before deciding whether your child can go to a friend&rsquo;s house. For example, is your child&rsquo;s friend allowed to use the internet independently?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Awareness</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Risks:</strong> Discuss the potential dangers of social media, including exposure to inappropriate content, cyberbullying, and privacy breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parental &lsquo;Friending&rsquo;:</strong> Consider 'friending' or &lsquo;following&rsquo; your child on social media platforms to remain informed about their online presence and use.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accidental Exposure:</strong> Understand that children can accidentally encounter unsuitable content online. Discuss with your child how online behaviour can affect others and the importance of digital empathy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utilizing Parental Controls</strong></p>
<p>Many digital devices, services and content providers offer a range of parental controls. You can choose the type of content and options that are suitable for your child.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Informed and Selective:</strong> Use parental controls available on digital devices, apps, and content providers. Tailor these controls to suit your child&rsquo;s needs.</li>
<li><strong>App Awareness:</strong> Regularly check app reviews and ratings. Be mindful of in-app purchase options and their implications.</li>
<li><strong>Profiles:</strong> Set up profiles for different household members on streaming services, so your child can&rsquo;t choose inappropriate programs.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-Friendly Alternatives:</strong> Use child-friendly search engines like Kiddle or Kidtopia, or content providers like ABC Kids, CBeebies, YouTube Kids and KIDOZ, or messaging apps like Messenger Kids. You can also search online for a &lsquo;clean&rsquo;, kid-friendly version, or a &lsquo;pg-version&rsquo; of a movie or a show you&rsquo;d like to watch with your family.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> A valuable resource for parents to gauge if content is age-appropriate and aligns with family values. Offers in-depth descriptions of content that may be considered inappropriate for children.</li>
<li><strong>Ask About Games:</strong> Offers insights into understanding video games and their ratings, helping parents make informed choices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Parental involvement in a child&rsquo;s digital life is key to ensuring their online safety. By understanding the risks, actively participating in their digital experiences, and setting appropriate boundaries, parents can help their children navigate the online world safely. Remember, the goal is not to shield them from technology but to equip them with the knowledge and tools to use it responsibly and safely.</p>
